The Amanzi\u2122 Time series specification is intended to be a fully comprehensive format supporting the following kinds of datasets: Real time (e.g sensor data), Historical (both modeled and observed) Projections (forecasts into the future). Storing Time Series data efficiently Time series data is a challenging beast to handle efficiently at scale and there have been numerous implementations attempting to solve the problem. The Amanzi\u2122 specification for storage has six major objectives: Keep the storage solution simple but efficient. Easily allow for local (users harddisk) or remote storage options. Store in a format that is commonly used for processing the data. Always preserve raw data from an origin datasource for a specified period of time. Store time series records in such a way that allows for partial reads/pagination. Flexible enough to handle very structured data or completely unstructured data. Providing sensible ways to process time series data Through the implementations of this specification the goal is to provide a default set of operations that are commonly performed on time series data. See Implementations for a list of implementations of this specification. Transmitting time series data To transmit time series data to multiple components in a cloud based system a common structure is needed. There are many things to consider when deciding on a format for transport such as: Size of the data The client device that will eventually receive the data(e.g browser, your harddrive, or another server) The transport protocol used to transmit the data to its destination. For most Browser based applications HTTP using a transport format of json is recommended, however its important that the data is appropriately set up for partial reads, or pagination as very large json data sets will reduce your users performance significantly. For server to server communication ideally HTTP2 with a binary protobuf format is recommended.
